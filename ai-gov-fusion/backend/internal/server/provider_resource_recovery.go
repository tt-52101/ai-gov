// happens to succeed after the breaker opened would close it: requests A and B start
// while the resource is healthy, A fails and trips the breaker, then B returns
// successfully and finds the resource unhealthy. B never held a trial permit and its
// success says nothing about the state that tripped the breaker, so it must not
// recover the resource. Only the claimant may.
//
// Carrying this in the context rather than a column is safe because the claim and the
// completion always happen inside the same request on the same replica. It also
// survives MaxConcurrency == 0, where no lease ID is issued at all.

// background prober: once the deadline lapses the resource is admitted back into the
// candidate pool, the first request to reach capacity admission claims the trial by
// pushing the deadline forward, and a confirmed upstream success closes the breaker.
//
// Pushing cooldown_until forward is the whole mechanism. Because it happens inside the
// admission transaction it is simultaneously the concurrency limit (one trial in
// flight per resource), the failure backoff (a failed trial has already armed the next
// window) and the cross-replica guard (any replica losing the compare-and-set is
// rejected). No extra column, scheduler or lock is involved.
